# Food-Data---EDA
An EDA analysis done on the indian food data.
This project is a data analysis and exploration project that focuses on food data. It uses a dataset of food items and their nutritional information for exploration and visualization. The project is implemented using Python and several libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly. The aim of the project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the food dataset and to understand the various aspects and patterns present in the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and creating various visualizations to gain insights from the data. The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook which contains the code for EDA.
